# Eleventy QuickStart Project Setup

This is a small, focused Eleventy Quickstart boilerplate I built for myself to use for future Eleventy projects. The focus is on approachable HTML, CSS, JS and Using Liquid for Components-style set-up and Templating.

SEO and Meta information is pre-templated in the `metadata.json` file, templated into `meta.liquid`.

Fie CSS files split into design elements and combined into theme.css at build time.

## Getting Started

Git clone to download GitHub Repo `git clone repo-url.com clone-name`

Build project `eleventy`

Live reload `eleventy --serve`
